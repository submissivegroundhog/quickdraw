# quickdraw
Quick Draw is a reaction time test game. After choosing the level of difficulty, you face your opponent (the computer), wait for the signal, and then shoot with your gun as fast as possible. Only a true gunslinger will survive all of these epic duels! How long will you last once you start playing Quick Draw?
